# Bandwidth-and-Latency

## Bandwidth
### Definition:
Bandwidth is the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted over a network connection per second.

Unit: Measured in bits per second (bps), usually in Mbps (Megabits/sec) or Gbps (Gigabits/sec).

Think of it like a highway: More lanes = more cars (data) can move at once.

### Higher Bandwidth = More Data at Once
Bandwidth	Meaning
10 Mbps	10 million bits per second
100 Mbps	100 million bits per second
1 Gbps	1 billion bits per second

## Latency
### Definition:
Latency is the time it takes for a data packet to travel from one point to another — usually measured as ping time in milliseconds (ms).

Think of it like a delay in communication.

Even with high bandwidth, high latency can cause lag.

### Lower Latency = Faster Response Time
Latency	Experience
< 20 ms	Excellent (e.g., gaming, voice calls)
20–100 ms	Good for most tasks
> 100 ms	Noticeable delay or lag
